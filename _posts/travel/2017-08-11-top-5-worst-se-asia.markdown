   title: Trash

---

So over the past month I’ve traveled around a good portion of Thailand and a little bit of Cambodia and I’d like to share a few of my experiences. Originally the plan was to make top five and bottom five lists about each place I visit. Top 5 Worst Things about Bangkok, Top 5 Best Things about Bangkok, Top 5 Worst Things about Phnom Penh, Top 5 Best Things… You get it. The problem is, I’d want these lists to be unique to each location and after traveling around the area a bit, I’ve realized that the things I really like and the things I really dislike are more or less the same wherever I go. In order to get a true snapshot of what makes each location uniquely good or bad, I would have to spend much more time exploring them than I have so far. 

So instead, I’m just going to make a top five and bottom five list about my overall experience so far in Southeast Asia. Keep in mind that I’ve only visited small portions of Thailand and Cambodia so far, and my experiences have been fairly limited, so this might not paint a full picture of… yada yada yada.

Since I enjoy complaining, I think I’ll start with the worst of the worst. So here are the five things about living in Southeast Asia that I have found most disagreeable.

## 5. It’s Unbelievably Humid

I’m from the Midwest United States. If you’ve ever been to the Midwest during the summer, you know it gets pretty hot and humid. Because of this, I’m used to summer temperatures in the mid-to-high 90s (Fahrenheit master race) and what I would have previously considered high humidity. I’ve experienced plenty of days in Kansas and Missouri where I walk outside and immediately feel like I’m melting. So I’m no stranger to temperature and humidity levels that make the idea leaving your air conditioned home a source of anxiety.

Yet somehow, this experience still has not prepared me for how freakin’ humid it is over here. I don’t know what it is. If I had to guess, I’d say the air pollution probably makes it worse. But when I was staying in the larger cities, specifically Bangkok and Phnom Penh, no matter what the temperature was, I would walk outside and immediate sweat through my shirt. Every. Single. Day.

And the crazy thing is, it’s not even that hot over here. It never really seems to get above low 90s (Fahrenheit master race). There have been plenty of days where the temperature stayed in the mid 80s and, if it weren’t for the damn humidity, would have been very pleasant. It’s just that the air here seems to drape itself around you like some sort of hot, damp blanket. Not ok.

I have yet to see a Thai person walking around soaked through their shirt with sweat so I assume they have some sort of genetic superpower that allows them to avoid the discomfort of such high humidity. If you’re a hairy, sweaty westerner like me, though, be sure you always carry around an extra set of clothes.

## 4. The Traffic is Terrible

So this is something that I was ready to say that was unique to Bangkok. As far as Thailand is concerned, the traffic in the northern cities like Chiang Mai is pretty tame. The traffic in the southern cities like Patong and Phuket Town isn’t great, but it never seemed quite as dangerous and disorganized as the traffic in Bangkok. But then I visited to Phnom Penh, Cambodia and realized that [b-b-b-baby I just ain’t seen n-n-nothin’ yet](/blog/travel-tunes/). Since then I’ve come to the conclusion that awful traffic is pretty commonplace over here.

So I suppose I should start by describing Bangkok traffic since I feel it is a solid baseline for terrible Southeast Asian driving practices. First of all, people don’t honk at each other because they’re pissed about something. They honk to let those around them know where they are. This means traffic is constantly generating an incredible amount of noise. Secondly, people don’t really seem to care about signalling intent for any reason whatsoever. In order to change lanes it seems you just kind of get in between two lanes and see if that works out for you. If afterwards you notice you didn’t hit anything, then you’re good to go. There is no such thing as “cutting someone off” here. It’s just called “driving”. Finally, and most obnoxiously, the telltale sign that you are in awful Asian traffic is the horde of people on scooters and motorbikes doing whatever the hell they want. 

That light’s red? Nah, I’m pretty sure it’s green. 

Traffic goes the opposite direction in this lane? It’s cool I’ll only go the wrong way for a little while.

Put all these elements together and you get a pretty crazy driving experience. But at least Bangkok has traffic signals, and lane markings, and for the most part the only things on the roads are some sort of vehicle.

I don’t even know how to describe traffic in Phnom Penh, but I feel the need to use the word “insane”. There, traffic signals are only reserved for intersections where not having a traffic signal would make traveling by car impossible (think huge intersections with like four lanes going each way). This means the majority of intersections are completely unmarked. In the U.S. you usually treat an unmarked intersection as a four-way stop or at least yield as you approach. In Phnom Penh, drivers have agreed to treat these intersections as four-way-everyone-do-whatever-the-hell-you-wants. Everyone slowly enters the intersection at the same time and just figures it out. As you can imagine, sometimes that doesn’t work so well. 

Also from what I gather, there’s no hard and fast rule about where you can and cannot drive on the roads in Cambodia. It seems that during rush hour, the flow of traffic decides which lanes go which direction. Between that and the people who have decided that their little food stall must take up half a lane of a major thoroughfare things can get out of hand.

## 3. It’s Super Dirty and It Stinks

By U.S. standards pretty much everything over here is dirty. In many of the cities there is an unbelieveable amount of trash on the side of the road. The roads themselves are generally covered in dirt and dust which means that every time you ride in an open-air vehicle (which is pretty often) at least a little bit of dirt will get in your mouth and eyes. The air pollution here is significantly worse. Every building seems to have some sort of mold or mildew problem, or at the very least needs a new coat of paint. If you’re outside the larger cities there is a good chance you will have to use one of the infamous “squatty potties” and if you’re unlucky enough to have left your toilet paper at home you will have to “wipe” with water. 

If you’re a germaphobe, I don’t know what to tell you. Probably either “don’t be a germaphobe” or “don’t come to Southeast Asia”.

It also smells really bad over here. The air contains a potent and unique combination of nastiness, a combination that is difficult, if not impossible, to describe with words.  So I’ll just leave this here:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZrS5VOsc50?start=45&end=78" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The part about the apartment building is actually incredibly accurate. 

If I had to describe it myself, I’d say it’s a combination of cat urine, wet dog, [durian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian) (which kind of smells like if a dead animal was also fruit), hot garbage, a general “something’s burning” smell, and mothballs. That, plus crap.

## 2. The Tourists Are Awful

Alright, two things. First of all, I don’t mean to suggest that being a tourist or acting like a tourist is bad. I’ve learned that for the most part, all tourists act pretty similarly regardless of their nationality. We are all clueless and clumsy and awkward when we visit a new place, especially if it’s a place where day-to-day life is vastly different than what we’re used to back home. Plus, when we travel, we’re usually on vacation. While on vacation we are trying to escape the monotony and responsibility of life at home and are more likely to let loose and not care as much about how we look or act.

Secondly, I’m not going to sit here and pretend I’m not a tourist just because I technically live here. While I’ve probably had more time to adjust than most, I still make clumsy mistakes, wear goofy clothes, and eat Burger King too much just like all the other foreigners here. There is nothing wrong with any of that and those are not the reasons I say tourists are an issue here.

Now that tourist apologist Aaron has had his say, let’s get down to the real issue here. In my experience, the majority of tourists in Thailand and Cambodia are assholes. Hard to sugarcoat it. A solid portion of the foreign population here is made up of trust fund party kids (or more accurately trust fund party adults) who think they own the place because they’re western and speak English. They are incredibly rude to the locals and get frustrated when English is not understood. They don’t give a shit about the culture beyond the handful of the major tourist attractions and really don’t want to do anything besides get wasted and have sex with other trust fund party kid foreigners.

But of course, there are two sides to this issue. Cities like Bangkok and Siem Reap (the town just outside Angkor Wat) market themselves as party central and boast “Backpacker Meccas” like Khaosan Road. Places like this specifically cater to that party kid crowd. You take a stroll down these lanes and you’re bombarded with music, cheap food and drinks, literal buckets of alcohol, scantily clad women, street vendors selling fried scorpions and offensive t-shirts, and fellow travelers from every country you can imagine. It’s intoxicating, but it’s Disney World. Well, it’s what Disney World would have been had Walt Disney been an alcoholic pimp with a gambling problem. My point is, very little of what you see in these areas is really Bangkok, or Phnom Penh, or Siem Reap, or wherever, and it’s like that because the locals know they can make a ton of money.

Now, I’ve never lived in an area that has a high tourist population so it’s very possible I am just complaining about tourists and tourism in general. It’s just that I find that in this part of the world, tourists and locals have an especially toxic relationship. Locals think that all tourists are obnoxious drunken assholes and all tourists think that all locals are sleazy scam artists. And because everyone only sees each other in the context of Disney Epcot’s Southeast Asia (tm) they’re both right.

## 1. I Swear to God, If I See One More Street Salesman...

You know it has to be bad if it comes in under that wonderful tourist rant. 

Honestly, for me it’s not even close. Street salesmen take the number one spot by a landslide. Obviously things are worse in the larger cities like Bangkok and Phnom Penh, but really it seems no matter where you go, everyone is trying to sell you something. And not passively either. If you are a westerner, you will be approached by at least one person trying to sell you something every time you step foot outside your hotel room. Period. You simply cannot walk from one place to another without it happening. 
First up you have the tuk tuk drivers. You cannot go anywhere without a tuk tuk driving yelling or honking at you to get in. I wish I would have started counting how many times I’ve been solicited by tuk tuk drivers when I got here. I’ve been here for a little over a month now and if I was a betting man I’d say it’s over 300 times, or on average 10 times a day. 

In the bigger cities like Bangkok and Phnom Penh, these guys are super organized and aggressive. They all hang out together on street corners and tend to have a ring leader that yells, “Hey buddy! Where you going?” Apparently that is the one million dollar question. And if I hear it one more time I’m going to throw something at the person who asks me. I’ve learned that saying, “This way” and continuing to walk is the correct response to that question. If you try to be polite, they try to bully you into buying a ride. If you ignore them, they get more aggressive.

Tuk tuk drivers will also just straight up lie to you about how far away things are. I once had a driver near Angkor Wat follow me for a full kilometer down the road trying to tell me I couldn’t walk to where I was going because it was 10 kilometers away. Well I knew damn well it was only 2 kilometers away and guess what? I made it there just fine.

But it’s not just the tuk tuk drivers. There are groups of guys who walk around with “Security” on the front of official looking vests who I guess you can pay to lead you around. They speak English very well and are super friendly, at least until they realize you’re not going to buy anything from them. Now it’s important to not get them confused with actual security guards who look very similar. Rule of thumb, if they talk to you, they’re trying to sell you something. Their catchphrase also seems to be the, “Hey buddy! Where you going?”

Then there are the random guys outside of temples that try to get you to pay them an entrance fee or tell you the temple’s closed. Luckily, they know an even better temple right around the corner! How convenient! Well the problem with that is most temples are free to visit and if they aren’t, they will have a legitimate ticket booth. And if they are closed, they are very obviously closed. That guy wouldn’t be sitting there trying to prevent you from going in, you just wouldn’t be able to go in. The mating call of the temple scammer: “Hey you pay! You want tour guide?”

And then there are the massage parlors, both the legitimate and slightly more, uh, friendly ones. Here you can find streets that have massage parlor after massage parlor where the masseuses sit out front and try to physically drag you into the shop when you walk by. Or, if instead you are more than an arm’s length away and ignoring them, they will come up to you and try to get you to pick something from their little massage menu. Fair warning, if you continue to ignore them when they do that, they may start smacking you and calling you names. This type of salesperson can be identified by the overly familiar greeting, “Hey sexy maaaan! You want massage?”

But wait there’s more! No matter where you go, there are just loads of average Joes walking down the street shoving pamphlets for Muay Thai fights or some Ramen restaurant into your hand. There are horribly weathered looking little old ladies trying to sell their homemade flower necklaces and paintings. There are children who come up to you crying because their mother is sick and the only way to help her is to buy their knock-off sunglasses. Only ten dolla. There are  middle eastern guys standing in the middle of the street trying to get you to come into their shop and buy a custom tailored suit at two in the morning. And those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.

It’s shitty and frustrating and exhausting and in a lot of places it’s like this all the time, every day. Because of this, I have concluded that street salesmen are my least favorite thing about Southeast Asia.

Well that’s enough complaining for now. Here is where I would say something along the lines of “let me know what you think” or “what are your least favorite things”, but I don’t have comments set up on the site yet. So feel free to do it on Facebook or Instagram or wherever you feel like it.

Next time I’ll be a little more positive and recap my top five favorite things about Southeast Asia so far.
