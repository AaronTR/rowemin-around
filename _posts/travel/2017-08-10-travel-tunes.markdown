Super short post, but quality over quantity or something like that...

For me, memories and sounds have always been very closely connected. Listening to a song that played during a past event is one of the easiest ways for me to clearly recall memories of that event. So I made a playlist to go along with my trip. 

I tried to choose travel-themed songs that I enjoy listening to, but don’t listen to very often. Since I haven't already associated these songs with past experiences, they can be used to create new memories. Or at least that’s the idea anyway. Hopefully now future me will get to look back fondly on my travel experiences whenever I hear one of these songs. Thanks, past me. You’re a real bro.

And even if it doesn’t help you remember your travels, every trip needs its own playlist right? Especially if that trip’s going to change your entire life. So without further ado, here’s my travel playlist complete with links to YouTube videos for each song.
