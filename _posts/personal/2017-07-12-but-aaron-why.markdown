Good question.

I've learned this question is pretty much the standard response when you tell your family and friends that you're quitting your job and moving to the other side of the world for an indefinite period of time. It's delivered in different ways. The ones who know you best will most likely come right out and say it. Those you're less familiar with will ask it with the look they give you.

"Did I hear him right?"

"What happened? Is he ok?"

"He always has these sorts of ideas. I guess I'll humor him one more time."

And you know, that's fair. This is not something that a lot of people do. Sure, it's something that everyone thinks about at three o'clock in the afternoon sitting in their cubicle, but the majority of us suck it up, finish our work day, and go home to our families. I believe everyone struggles with this. Asking ourselves the great "what ifs" and wondering if the grass really is as green as it seems over there. But in the end most people ignore these feelings.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean to say ignoring these feelings, is a bad thing. In fact, I believe a lot of times it's a very good thing. When we ignore the "what ifs" it means that there is something keeping us where we are. For whatever reason, something makes us stay. Maybe we are raising a family, or starting a career. Maybe our work fulfills us in a way that we know chasing daydreams never could. Maybe we just like where we are and that's all we really need. Whatever it is, most of the time it's something comfortable, something happy. Well, here is where we find my reason for leaving:

I was not comfortable. I was not happy.

I've realized that I am a creature of habit, no matter how hard I try to avoid it. I live in cycles. My cycle starts with a perceived goal: something that I believe I want to have, like a degree or a job. I work my ass off to achieve this goal and once I do, I feel a sense of accomplishment and this makes me relatively happy. But always this happiness is short lived. Inevitably, I begin to realize this thing I worked so hard to earn isn't quite what I thought it would be. Once the apathy sets in, I tend to do something rash. I pursue whatever vice makes me happy here and now because God knows I need something to liven up my day. After this decision backfires, it's time to for me to buckle down and improve my life. So I set my sights on another poorly conceived goal and the cycle begins again.

I don't know about you, but to me that doesn't sound like a healthy way to live. So after this last round of questionable decision-making I took some time to sit down and think about what I really want out of life. If this cycle is so unacceptable why do I repeat it? And how do I break it? Well, after some serious reflection I realized the answer was actually very simple. The goals that I set for myself centered around what was expected of me, not around what _I_ wanted. If I am to be truly happy, I have to be true to myself. So I sat down and spent some time trying to honestly answer the question we all ask ourselves from time to time, a question that I think too few of us really consider:

"If you could do anything at all, what would you do with your life?"

For me, the answer has been the same for a very long time. It's an answer that I believe a lot of people would have to that question. If I could do anything, I would travel the world.

Of course, like most people who share this dream of mine, I've kept it in the back of my mind knowing full well that it's not truly possible. I mean, it's super expensive right? Where would I get the money to do all that? What about my career? No one really quits their job to travel the world. This is just a childish dream and now is the time for me to grow up and accept responsibility like a real adult.

Well you know what? Fuck that.

In asking myself this question I realized that the real problem was me. I realized that I was the one telling myself that my dream was invalid because it didn't fit the acceptable dream mold. I realized that if I truly wanted to, I could live my dream. So now I am.

 I quit my salaried programming job, switched to freelancing, and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. Right now I'm sitting in a hostel overlooking downtown Bangkok. The city is loud and smelly and hot and humid. I can't step outside without immediately sweating through my clothes. I can't understand 90% of what people are saying to me. The toilets don't even have toilet paper for fuck's sake. I am poor, I am technically homeless, I carry all my shit around with me in a giant backpack. I am tired and hungry and slightly nauseous. But I'm happy.

 In the end, who knows if this is just another rash decision. It's very possible that I could fail miserably, dry up all my funds, alienate all my contacts, and have to come crawling back home with my tail between my legs. But if this is a rash decision, it's by far the best one I've ever made. And if I fail, I'll know that I at least attempted to live my dream which is something I will never regret.

 So I suppose that's why I'm doing it.

 Anywho... This is my blog where you can follow along with my travels if you'd like. I know I got a little real in this first one, but future blog posts will most likely be more light-hearted summaries of my day-to-day adventures, how funding long term travel isn't as difficult as most people think, and what it's like to work on the road. If you're down for that then stick around.

 That's probably enough for now, but I'll end with this. I don't intend to suggest that I'm in the right for leaving my life behind to travel and those who don't are in the wrong. We all travel different paths through life and I truly believe all are equally valid. But I will say this: be brave enough to be true to yourself. Whatever it is you want out of life, take the chances and make the sacrifices necessary to make it yours. And if what you want happens to be long-term travel, know that there's always an open seat and a cold beer across the table from me on the other side of the world.
