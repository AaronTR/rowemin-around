Sure Southeast Asia has it’s flaws, but it’s also an incredible place to live. Now that we’ve gotten all the complaints out of the way with that [last post](/blog/top-5-worst-se-asia), it’s time to circle back and recap the Top 5 Best Things About Living In Southeast Asia.

This list was very hard to make because there is so much to love here. Again, I have not had enough time to experience everything that Southeast Asia has to offer, so think of this as more of a first impression of the area. Unlike last time, however, I’ve found that each area of Thailand and Cambodia I’ve visited differs slightly in food, culture, architecture, etc from one to next, making each awesome in it’s own way. I’d love to take the time to further explore each region and share all they have to offer. But, for now I’ll keep this list limited to things that all of the areas I've visited have in common.

Let’s get crackin’.

## 5. Temples

Kicking things off, we have temples. If you’re making a top 5 list about Southeast Asia it’s pretty much a given that you’ll mention temples. They’re everywhere. Like seriously everywhere. In the urban areas of Thailand and Cambodia it’s hard to walk more than a couple blocks without running into a temple. And every single one of them is absolutely beautiful.

In the U.S., we simply don’t have anything like them. Since the majority of our population is Christian, the majority of our religious buildings are churches and cathedrals disigned with traditional western style Christian architectures in mind. Over here, the majority of the population is Buddhist and historically Hindu ([waaaaay back in the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat#History)). Because of this you get these massive, intricately designed temples using traditional Buddhist and Hindu architecture.  Comparing the two styles is comparing apples to oranges. Obviously one’s not objectively better than the other, but as a clueless westerner, experiencing a “real” Buddhist temple for the first time was sort of mind blowing. 

The attention to detail in the construction of these temples is truly amazing. Often times the facades are entirely covered with hand-carved designs and representations of deities. And the designs vary so much from structure to structure. The interiors sport enormous golden Buddha statues and floor to ceiling murals depicting Buddhist tales and fables. The temple grounds almost always contain a collection of [Chedis, Prangs, and Ubosots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_temple_art_and_architecture) (yeah I know, just click the link) and have steeply sloped roofs adorned with [Naga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nāga) fins. 

So damn cool. If you’re like me and have trouble pulling yourself out of the Wikipedia rabbit hole once you’re down there, I apologize in advance.

## 4. Beautiful Cities and Scenery

Number four on my list is a combination of landscapes and cityscapes of Southeast Asia. This place is easily one of the most beautiful areas I’ve ever visited. Whether you’re in a city or driving through the countryside, the scenery is fantastic.

In the larger cities like Bangkok and Phnom Penh you get this mass of controlled chaos. There are people everywhere. There are animals everywhere. You can walk through these cities and spot a secluded alleyway, but if you take the time to venture down there, you’ll realize it wasn’t really secluded at all. It’s just the entryway to a different neighborhood. Kids are yelling and chasing each other, dog are barking, old women are hanging clothes. There is life everywhere, just waiting for you to explore it.

In the previous post I mentioned that everything is pretty dirty and most buildings could use an extra coat of paint or a little bit of mold removal. Well it sounds weird but that aesthetic just kinda works over here. It’s like the whole area has this damp jungly theme to it. And yet each city has it’s own unique little twist on that theme. For instance, Phnom Penh is incredibly dusty with red dirt encroaching on the sides of the road wherever you go, giving it almost a Wild West feeling. On the other hand, you have Bangkok where trees and other greenery line nearly every road, giving you the feeling that you never really left the jungle in the first place.

And things only get better when you’re outside the city. While Thailand’s landscape seems to vary slightly more than Cambodia’s, both are beautiful in their own way. Thailand is incredible in it’s ability to quickly change from mountains to plains, back to mountains, and then immediately to beaches. Cambodia on the other hand, seems to either be flat wetlands or large swaths of farmland mixed with more of that orange-red dirt. Tropical trees are scattered everywhere and large, lone hills jut out of the ground apart from any larger rock formation. Completely different than anything I’ve seen back home.

I should really get better at taking pictures of this stuff.

## 3. It Smells Amazing

It’s true, Southeast Asia smells terrible. But for every reaction I’ve had to some horrible smelly surprise, there has been an equal and opposite reaction to something that smells amazing. 

For every sour animal smell there is the sweet smell of a street cart selling crepes with it’s fresh batter and maple syrup. 

For every durian there are a hundred mangos, and melons, and dragonfruit and any other wonderful smelling fruit you can imagine. And walking down markets with aisles upon aisles of these can only be described as heavenly. 

For every hot garbage smell there is the smell of grilling meat and vegetables and spices that you didn’t even know existed. 

And without fail, that general “something’s burning” smell is followed by some unique flavor of incense chosen for someone’s offering at the temple around the corner. 

So yes, this area is smelly in that it smells strongly. But it smells strongly of delicious goodness just as strongly as it smells of feces. Just be prepared to have a very confused nose as you walk down the street.

## 2. The Food

And now we move from the smells to the tastes. As I alluded to in number three up there, the smell of the amazing food is pretty much the only thing preventing this area from smelling like a dump all the time. But boy does it ever.

Over here there are thousands of street stalls selling everything from fried chicken to coconut ice cream. Just like you can’t walk down the street without being honked at by a tuk tuk driver, you can’t walk down that same street without running into a handful of fresh fruit stands that will make you a smoothie out of just about anything. Then there are the community style local restaurants you’re forced to pass by. Each complete with hot meaty steam pouring out from underneath their awnings. And you simply can’t beat the enormous outdoor markets with their fresh fruits and veggies.

Walking from place to place, no matter the time of day, becomes an involuntary culinary experience. This can really be a problem if you lack self control like yours truly. There have been multiple times, once with consecutive food stalls, where I walked by, smelled what they were cooking, and immediately had to stop and buy that thing. It’s really that good.

## 1. The Price

Sounds shallow doesn’t it? Like I’m supposed to say number one is the people or the culture or something right? Nope, number one on this list is all about the Benjamins.

<div class="blog-post-aside">
  <div>
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/top-5-best-se-asia/riel-min.jpg" alt="Cambodian Currency">
    <span>100 Cambodian Riel (less than $0.03)</span>
  </div>
  <p>
    Fun fact: Cambodia actually uses the U.S. Dollar as its unofficial national currency. Essentially, they use the USD as their “dollar”, but instead of giving you change in U.S. coins, they give you change in Cambodian Riel since it’s like 4000 Riel to $1. Thought that was nifty. However, since the cost of living is pretty similar between Thailand and Cambodia, and since I’ve spent enough time in Thailand to establish a spending pattern, I’ll be comparing prices to Thai Baht. Ok, back to the blog...
  </p>
</div>

For an American, it’s super cheap to live in Southeast Asia. In Thailand, one U.S. Dollar is equal to around 33 Thai Baht (฿33). But since that doesn’t really give you any sense of what things cost I’ll just walk you through the expenses for an average day in the life of Aaron.

So first of all, I am renting a room in the Thai city of Chiang Mai. I’ve made a deal with the owner to pay 5000 Thai Baht for a total of 25 days. And since $1 is ฿33, that means my almost-month’s worth of rent is roughly $150. Now to be honest with you, this isn’t a great price. If you’re able to stay for a longer period of time and don’t have to find a place on such short notice (or aren’t foreign), you could easily find a place to rent for ฿3000 - ฿3500, or around $100, for a full month. But even at this not so great price of $150 for 25 days, this averages out to a whopping $6 per day of housing expenses. I’ll take it.

My other big expense for the month was a membership to a coworking space. Not necessary since I could just work out of cafes, but I find coworking spaces consistently provide an environment that works to maximize developer efficiency. Plus they have free snacks. So that was ฿3500, or $106, for the next 25 days. That puts us at a grand total of $256 or $10.25-ish per day for 25 days of living and working expenses.

So with that out of the way, let’s recap an average daily routine. First things first I get up and, poof!, there goes my $10.25 for daily living and working expenses. I live close enough to where I work to walk there and most days I will stop along the way at this place that serves awesome fruit smoothies. I buy a 24 ounce smoothie for ฿30 ($0.91) and continue on to work where I can grab free coffee and snacks. 

After working for a bit it’s lunch time so I head out for a bite to eat. There’s a Burger King nearby and lately that’s sounded pretty good for lunch so let’s use that. I run into Burger King and get a Whopper meal for ฿209 ($6.33, not so cheap here) and I head back to work until it’s dinner time.

For whatever reason I’m more likely to get Thai food for dinner and here it’s really easy to find cheap Thai food. Shocking, I know. For example, last night I went to a Thai place near the coworking space and got fried rice with chicken and egg, and a coke to drink for ฿80 ($2.42). Now I’ve had a long day so naturally it’s time for a beer or two. So I head down to 7-Eleven where I know I can get two beers for another ฿80 (again $2.42). After that I will usually either walk around and explore for a bit or head back to work. Either way, it’s unlikely I will spend any more money during an average week day. 

Now if you’re good in the head with them there numbers, you can add that up and see that my daily expenses for food came to a total of $12.08 bringing my daily total to $22.33. This includes housing expenses, work expenses, and meal expenses. If we went ahead and assumed I would eat similarly priced meals every day for the next 25 days, that would bring my total living expenses to just over $555. Not too shabby.

Now of course that’s not entirely accurate. I’m pretty boring most days, but it’s not like all I do every single day is work and eat. You’d have to throw in some entertainment expenses on top of that every once in awhile. But the point is, here you can live and eat and work and play all for less than a month’s worth of rent back in the States. 

If you’re living like this while earning your paycheck in USD, it makes saving money ridiculously easy. Which means you have more money to spend on experiencing all of the other wonderful things in this list.
